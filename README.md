## Key Components
POM: Contains the Page Object Model (POM) classes that represent the web pages in the application.
tests: This directory includes all the test cases.
utilities: Utility functions and helper methods used across the framework.
conftest.py: Contains setup and teardown methods, fixtures, and configuration settings.
TestData.xls and locator.xls: Excel files containing test data and element locators.
Installation
To get started with the SupplyChain pytest framework, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

cd SupplyChain
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your machine.
```
## Usage
To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
Copy code
pytest
You can specify additional pytest options as needed, such as running specific tests or generating reports.
```
### Example:
